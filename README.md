# W6D3 - WebSockets and Real Time Communication

We have a few examples here:

## Plain JS Example

You can find this example in the [`repeater`](./repeater) folder. This example shows how you can use `Express` along with the `WebSocket.Server` to run both in one server package.

## WS + React

You can find this example in the [`react-ws-example`]('./react-ws-example) folder. This example shows you some best practices in working with WebSockets in React as well as how to handle more than one type of message being sent over the socket.
